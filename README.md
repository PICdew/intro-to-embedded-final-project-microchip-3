## PIC MOTOR CONTROLLER FOR BLDC MOTOR

  The goal of the final project was to design a system that took in real world data, ana-lyzed that data, controlled something as a result of that data, and communicate witheither a computer or through wireless means.  The system that was created was aMotor Controller for a brushless DC (BLDC) motor capable of communicating overa Controller Area Network (CAN) using Microchipâ€™s dsPIC33EV256GM102 and CANtransceivers.

  On a top level view, the system reads a potentiometer value and the motor will spinat a speed consistent with that value.  This works with the motor under load so thatit can actually be used.  This can be achieved due to the nature of the closed loopsystem under which the motor is operating.  The motor reports its speed back to themicrocontroller and there it is determined whether the motor needs to spin faster orslower. This will be explained in more detail later in the report.
  
  The  inspiration  for  this  project  stems  from  the  Rowan  University  Formula  ElectricClinic.  That clinic is student run with the goal of building a fully-functional race readyformula style electric race car. The timeline is 2 years starting in the Fall of 2018. Theclinic is split into two parts, a mechanical side and an electrical side. This design wascreated with research intent towards the electrical side.  Since the car is being builtfrom the ground up, some of the parts and components need to be tested in house.This design is one of those test models and attempts to see if a motor controller couldbe created in house by the members of the team.  Hopefully this design will provideuseful information that can be used by members of the Formula Electric team.
  
  The system that was created is a motor controller that communicates over CAN. Thereare  two  dsPIC33EV256GM102  microcontrollers  set  up  to  communicate  over  CAN.One reads, analyzes, and transmits data from a potentiometer.  The other reads thedata from the first microcontroller as well as data from the hall effect sensor in themotor to control the speed of the motor. The second PIC will then determine whetherthe motor needs to speed up or slow down using an algorithm and transmit data incorrespondence to the data received and send it to the gate drivers and motor drivers.These drivers will then spin the motor appropriately
